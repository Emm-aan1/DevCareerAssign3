**What is Redactr?**

Redactr is a web application that helps you share content on social media safely!  Think   before you post! 

With Redactr, you can replace sensitive words with your chosen redaction characters (like asterisks  , question marks  , or even custom words!), allowing you to express yourself freely while protecting your privacy.  

**How Does it Work?**

It's as easy as 1Ô∏è‚É£, 2Ô∏è‚É£, 3Ô∏è‚É£!

1. Enter your text in the designated text area (Ô∏è üó®Ô∏è that box up there!).
2. Specify the words you want to scramble by separating them with commas in the "Words to Scramble" field (",").
3. Click the "Redact Now" button (that big red button! ).
4. Redactr scans your text, replaces the specified words with üò∂‚Äçüå´Ô∏è character(s), and displays the redacted text.

**Features:**

* ‚ú® Simple and user-friendly interface (easy to use for everyone!)
*  Scramble single words or phrases (target those specific words!)
